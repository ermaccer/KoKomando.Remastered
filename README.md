4:3 values and is centered.

## 🌍 Extended Draw Distance

KoKomando Remastered allows to multiply draw distance value by any number. Default setting is 1.75x, larger ones
might break certain levels and their art direction.

**Note: Some levels are not affected by these changes for an unknown reason. Very large draw distance values can lower the FPS!**
